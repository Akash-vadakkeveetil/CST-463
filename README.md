Creating a website to store your cooking recipes with a focus on high-protein foods is a great idea! Here’s how you can incorporate all 18 HTML5 topics into this project:

### Website Idea: **"Protein-Packed Recipes"**

#### **1. Home Page:**
- **Headings**: Use headings to introduce your site (e.g., "Welcome to Protein-Packed Recipes" and "Discover High-Protein Meals").
- **Special Characters**: Incorporate special characters like `&copy;` for copyright at the footer, or use symbols like `✓` to mark features.
- **Horizontal Rules**: Separate sections such as Featured Recipes, Recent Posts, and About with horizontal rules.
- **Internal Linking**: Create a navigation bar with links to other sections of your site like Recipe Categories, Nutritional Info, and Contact.

#### **2. Recipe Categories Page:**
- **Lists**: Display a categorized list of recipes, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, and Protein Shakes. Use unordered or ordered lists for the recipe names.
- **Images**: Add images for each recipe category, such as a picture of a protein smoothie for the Shakes category.

#### **3. Individual Recipe Page:**
- **Tables**: Use tables to display nutritional information like calories, protein, carbs, and fat content for each recipe.
- **Forms**: Include a comment form for visitors to share their thoughts or variations on the recipe.
- **HTML5 Form Input Types**: Use specific input types for the form, like email for subscribing to updates or date for the preparation date.

#### **4. Nutrition Tips Page:**
- **Headings**: Structure content with headings, such as "Why Protein is Important" and "Tips for Maximizing Protein Intake."
- **Meta Elements**: Use meta tags to enhance the page’s SEO, targeting keywords related to high-protein diets and fitness.
- **Hyperlinks**: Provide links to scientific articles or studies that support the nutritional advice given.

#### **5. Recipe Submission Page:**
- **Forms**: Create a form where users can submit their own protein-packed recipes, including fields for ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional information.
- **Autocomplete Attribute**: Implement autocomplete to improve user experience when filling out their details.

#### **6. Media Gallery Page:**
- **Multimedia**: Include cooking tutorial videos and podcasts discussing nutrition for gym enthusiasts.
- **HTML5 Audio & Video Elements**: Embed videos of you preparing the recipes or discussing their nutritional benefits.

#### **7. About Page:**
- **Page Structure Elements**: Use HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize content about your fitness journey and the importance of a protein-rich diet.
- **Special Characters & Horizontal Rules**: Enhance the design with special characters and horizontal rules to break up sections.

#### **8. Contact Us Page:**
- **Forms**: Include a contact form for visitors to ask questions or connect with you about fitness and nutrition.
- **Input and Data List Elements**: Use a data list element to suggest topics for users when they type in their message.

### Future Enhancements:
- **CSS Styling**: Start with basic styling, using colors that represent health and fitness (e.g., greens and blues). Add more advanced features like responsive design and hover effects over time.
- **JavaScript Features**: Later on, you could implement a macro calculator, meal planner, or interactive content like quizzes about protein intake.
